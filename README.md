## Software developer at [Optimum](https://github.com/optimumBA)

I am a full-stack software developer working in the industry since 2012, both as part of teams and as a solo developer. I’m interested in learning new technologies, concepts, and business domains as well as managing development teams. Started the programming path as a hobby during the mid-2000s primarily using PHP along with Javascript, then Ruby on Rails. Since 2020, I’ve been completely focused on software development using Elixir, PostgreSQL, Phoenix, and related technologies.

Whether you’re building a PoC, or MVP app, or need someone to take over your app running in production, you’re at the right place!

Can help you with:  
🏗️ building new features  
👨‍🏭 refactoring existing code  
🧑‍💻 facilitating the developer onboarding experience  
📈 improving software development workflows and practices  
🚀 deploying Elixir apps to Fly.io, AWS, and Google Cloud  
🛠️ setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions

Also the manager of Optimum. This software development company specializes in full-stack development using Elixir, Phoenix, Phoenix LiveView, PostgreSQL, and Javascript.
